# Vercel Deployment Guide for PrepEngine

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

All configurations have been completed:
- [x] API URL automatically detects environment (local vs production)
- [x] Static file serving configured in Express
- [x] Package.json updated with correct entry point and all dependencies
- [x] Vercel.json configured for proper routing
- [x] Server exports app for serverless deployment

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Ensure all changes are committed to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "Add New Project"
   
3. **Import Repository**:
   - Select your PrepEngine repository
   - Vercel auto-detects `vercel.json`
   
4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" and wait 1-2 minutes

### Option 2: Deploy via CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
cd d:\GitHub\PrepEngine
vercel --prod
```

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### 1. API URL (js/api.js)
Auto-detects environment - uses localhost in dev, relative path in production

### 2. Static Files (server/server.js)
Added Express static middleware to serve frontend files

### 3. Package.json
Fixed entry point to `server/server.js` and consolidated dependencies

### 4. Vercel.json
Configured routes for API, static assets, and fallback routing

### 5. Serverless Mode
Server only starts in local dev, exports app for Vercel

## 🧪 Test Locally First

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and verify everything works

## 🌐 After Deployment

Test at `https://your-project.vercel.app`:
- Homepage and all pages
- API endpoints: `/api/courses`
- Login/signup functionality

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Database files are READ-ONLY on Vercel (serverless limitation)
- User data works fine (in-memory storage)
- Consider MongoDB Atlas for production persistence
- Cold starts may occur on first request

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Build fails**: Check Vercel build logs
- **API 404**: Verify routes in vercel.json
- **Files missing**: Ensure all committed to Git
- **CORS errors**: Check browser console

## 🎉 You're Ready!

All configurations are complete. Just push to GitHub and deploy via Vercel dashboard!
